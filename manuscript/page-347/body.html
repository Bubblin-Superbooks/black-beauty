<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">straw for my bed. Polly brought me a warm mash that made me comfortable, and then they locked the door.</p><p>It was late the next morning before any one came, and then it was only Harry. He cleaned us and fed us, and swept out the stalls, then he put the straw back again as if it was Sunday. He was very still, and neither whistled nor sang. At noon he came again and gave us our food and water; this time Dolly came with him; she was crying, and I could gather from what they said that Jerry was dangerously ill, and the doctor said it was a bad case. So two days passed, and there was great trouble indoors. We only saw Harry, and sometimes Dolly. I think she came for company, for Polly was always with Jerry, and he had to be kept very quiet.</p><p>On the third day, while Harry was in the stable, a tap came at the door, and Governor Grant came in.</p><p>“I wouldn't go to the house, my boy,” he said, “but I want to know how your father is.”</p></div> </div>
