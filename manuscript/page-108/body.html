<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">business. I have a letter from my brother-in-law, Sir Clifford Williams, of Clifford Hall. He wants me to find him a trustworthy young groom, about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman, who has lived with him thirty years, is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place. He would have eighteen shillings a week at first, a stable suit, a driving suit, a bedroom over the coachhouse, and a boy under him. Sir Clifford is a good master, and if you could get the place it would be a good start for you. I don't want to part with you, and if you left us I know John would lose his right hand.”</p><p>“That I should, sir,” said John, “but I would not stand in his light for the world.”</p><p>“How old are you, James?” said master.</p><p>“Nineteen next May, sir.”</p></div> </div>
