Here is a note.”</p><p>“Wait,” he said, “I will come.”</p><p>He shut the window, and was soon at the door.</p><p>“The worst of it is,” he said, “that my horse has been out all day and is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the other. What is to be done? Can I have your horse?”</p><p>“He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it, if you think fit, sir.”</p><p>“All right,” he said; “I will soon be ready.”</p><p>John stood by me and stroked my neck; I was very hot. The doctor came out with his riding-whip.</p><p>“You need not take that, sir,” said John; “Black Beauty will go till he drops. Take care of him, sir, if you can; I should not like any harm to come to him.”</p></div> </div>
