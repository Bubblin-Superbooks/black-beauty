<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Into this fine box the groom put me; it was clean, sweet, and airy. I never was in a better box than that, and the sides were not so high but that I could see all that went on through the iron rails that were at the top.</p><p>He gave me some very nice oats, he patted me, spoke kindly, and then went away.</p><p>When I had eaten my corn I looked round. In the stall next to mine stood a little fat gray pony, with a thick mane and tail, a very pretty head, and a pert little nose.</p><p>I put my head up to the iron rails at the top of my box, and said, “How do you do? What is your name?”</p><p>He turned round as far as his halter would allow, held up his head, and said, “My name is Merrylegs. I am very handsome; I carry the young ladies on my back, and sometimes I take our mistress out in the low chair. They think a great deal of me, and so does James. Are you going to live next door to me in the box?”</p></div> </div>
