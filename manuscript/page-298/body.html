She was a general favorite on the stand, and there was not a man who would not have seen her safely across the street, if Jerry had not been able to do it.</p><p>One cold windy day Dolly had brought Jerry a basin of something hot, and was standing by him while he ate it. He had scarcely begun when a gentleman, walking toward us very fast, held up his umbrella.
