I should not like to do him an injury, but I'll do it if you please, sir.”</p><p>“Well,” said his master, “I should not like him to take cold; but I don't like the smell of this stable. Do you think the drains are all right?”</p><p>“Well, sir, now you mention it, I think the drain does sometimes send back a smell; there may be something wrong, sir.”</p><p>“Then send for the bricklayer and have it seen to,” said his master.</p><p>“Yes, sir, I will.”</p></div> </div>
