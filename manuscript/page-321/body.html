I've had Mr. B—— here asking about your vote, and he wants to hire your cab for the election; he will call for an answer.”</p><p>“Well, Polly, you may say that my cab will be otherwise engaged. I should not like to have it pasted over with their great bills, and as to making Jack and Captain race about to the public-houses to bring up half-drunken voters, why, I think 'twould be an insult to the horses. No, I shan't do it.”</p></div> </div>
