His wife sent a boy this morning to say his father was in a high fever and could not get out, so I'm here instead.”</p><p>The next morning the same man came again.</p><p>“How is Sam?” inquired the governor.</p><p>“He's gone,” said the man.</p><p>“What, gone? You don't mean to say he's dead?”</p><p>“Just snuffed out,” said the other; “he died at four o'clock this morning; all yesterday he was raving—raving about Skinner, and having no Sundays. 'I never had a Sunday's rest,' these were his last words.”</p><p>No one spoke for a while, and then the governor said, “I'll tell you what, mates, this is a warning for us.”</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
