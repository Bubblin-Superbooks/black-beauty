We had a great deal of late work in the Christmas week, and Jerry's cough was bad; but however late we were, Polly sat up for him, and came out with a lantern to meet him, looking anxious and troubled.</p><p>On the evening of the New Year we had to take two gentlemen to a house in one of the West End Squares. We set them down at nine o'clock, and were told to come again at eleven, “but,” said one, “as it is a card party, you may have to wait a few minutes, but don't be late.”</p><p>As the clock struck eleven we were at the door, for Jerry was always punctual.
